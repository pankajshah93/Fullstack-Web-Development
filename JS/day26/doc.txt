arr.sort ();
[10,20,100]its not consider as array its consider as string 
isi liye ye sort nahi hote
in this sort work in [10,100,20] because its work on bits 
compare first number 10 and 20 10 is small then 20 and 100 bit compare
100 small


 //if you want to work properly then colparison operator add 
 arr.sort( call back function )
 arr.sort((a,b)=>{

 })
 if this is return -ve then b,a
 if this is return +ve then a,b
 if this is return 0 then same
